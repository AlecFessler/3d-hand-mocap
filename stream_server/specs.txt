One thread per camera stream, thread affinity to ccd0 cores for l3

Single oversized buffer per thread

Stream protocol {timestamp: 8 bytes, size: 4 bytes, frame: size bytes}

Decode with libav using nvdec, use decoder for buffering

Use a queue to align timestamps with frames exiting decoder

Handle delays in timestamp reception with a "cycle frame" mechanism
