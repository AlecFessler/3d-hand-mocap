lock_free_stack_t::lock_free_stack_t() noexcept : head({nullptr, 0})
/**
 * Creates an empty lock-free stack using atomic operations.
 *
 * The stack is implemented as a singly-linked list with an atomic head
 * pointer. The head pointer combines both the node address and a counter
 * to prevent the ABA problem in concurrent operations.
 *
 * The ABA problem is when:
 * 1. Thread A reads head pointing to node A
 * 2. Thread B pops node A and pushes node B
 * 3. Thread C pops node B and pushes node A
 * 4. Thread A continues, thinking head hasn't changed
 *
 * Our counter increments with every modification, making old values
 * of head distinguishable even if they point to the same node.
 *
 * Memory ordering is relaxed for initialization since no other threads
 * can access the stack yet.

   * Pushes a node onto the stack without using locks.
   *
   * The push operation works by:
   * 1. Reading the current head atomically
   * 2. Setting the new node's next pointer to current head
   * 3. Attempting to update head to point to new node
   * 4. Retrying if head was modified by another thread
   *
   * Memory ordering ensures:
   * - acquire: Sees the latest head value before updating
   * - release: Makes the new node visible to other threads
   *
   * The operation is lock-free but not wait-free - a thread may
   * need multiple attempts if there is contention, but system-wide
   * progress is guaranteed as some thread will always succeed.
   *
   * Parameters:
   *   node: Pointer to the node to push onto the stack
   *
   * Note: Node must not be null and should not be currently
   * in use by any other data structure
